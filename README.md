🐍 Java Snake Game
A classic Snake Game built in Java using Swing for the GUI. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eats food to grow longer, and must avoid running into the walls or itself. This project is a great demonstration of Java fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in a simple game development context.

🎮 Features
Responsive snake movement using arrow keys

Randomized food generation

Score tracking system

Self-collision and wall-collision detection

Game Over screen

Replay support without restarting the program

Modular code using OOP: GameFrame, GamePanel, and SnakeGame classes

🧠 OOP Concepts Used
Encapsulation – Game logic is well-contained within classes (GameFrame, GamePanel)

Abstraction – Only essential functionalities exposed through public methods

Inheritance – (If extended in future enhancements)

Modularity – Clear separation of game window setup, rendering, and logic

Polymorphism – Event handling via anonymous inner classes (e.g., KeyAdapter)
